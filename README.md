# 📦 @onchainsupply/storage

> A lightweight, composable Solidity library for encoding, decoding, and hashing onchain asset data — the foundation of trustless, content-addressed smart assets.

---

## ✨ Overview

`OnChainCodec` is a reusable smart contract utility library developed by **OnChainSupply**, built to support fully onchain asset storage, deterministic deployment, and tokenization. It is designed for projects building dynamic NFTs, decentralized media, file-bound token systems, and smart asset protocols.

This package enables:
- ✅ Base64 encoding for byte content (tokenURI-ready)
- 🔁 Content hashing via keccak256
- 🧩 Modular plug-in for onchain file storage and NFT metadata renderers
